contest is running\nAt the end of a contest, the user is given a prompt and redirected to the profile page\nUPDATE : In the next update, we would like to make this process happen completely on the frontend by storing the endtime of the contest, reducing API calls\nUPDATE : We would still maintain a connection with the server for mid-contest information like errors in problem statements and clarifications\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n

component. Its functionality can be studied in 2 parts\n   * \n   * 1. Editor :\n   * The editor is created using the \"Ace\" library\n   * The view uses ngAfterViewInit which is needed for @ViewChild decorator\n   * The code is stored as a formatted string, along with the language and theme\n   * \n   * The editor supports basic autocomplete and align (beautify) capabilities\n   * The code uses https://medium.com/@ofir3322/create-an-online-ide-with-angular-6-nodejs-part-1-163a939a7929 as a starting point\n   * \n   * The project also allows for running files via direct uploads\n   * \n   * 2. Directory Structure\n   * The directory is stored as a recursive list of objects of class type NavigationModel\n   * The structure supports file and folder creation, deletion and renaming\n   * Provides a system for modularising code and running with various imports and dependencies\n   */\n\n  @ViewChild('codeEditor') private editor: ElementRef;\n  private aceEditor : ace.Ace.Editor;\n
