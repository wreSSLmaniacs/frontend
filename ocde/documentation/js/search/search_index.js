contest is running\nAt the end of a contest, the user is given a prompt and redirected to the profile page\nUPDATE : In the next update, we would like to make this process happen completely on the frontend by storing the endtime of the contest, reducing API calls\nUPDATE : We would still maintain a connection with the server for mid-contest information like errors in problem statements and clarifications\n\n                    \n                \n\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n
